Git wont let me upload the music tracks. For now the first and third tracks 
are not uploaded. The game will attempt to load these files on boot, but they 
do not exist. Consider supplying the bgm directory with your own music, and 
title them track_1.wav and track_3.wav accordingly. Please make sure they are 
actually .wav files and the extension is not just cosmetic. Sorry, but this 
is the kind of relinquish we have to keep when uploading a game to github. 
Maybe I should have uploaded to sourceforge?
